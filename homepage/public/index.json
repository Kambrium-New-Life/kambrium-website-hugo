The company “Kambrium” is establishing a new civilization that operates and lives on this earth according to organic, harmonious, energetic, and spiritual principles in such a way that it can exist in harmony with the environment! The motto is cooperation between humans, animals, and all of creation! To achieve this, all areas of modern life must be rethought and adapted, and thus a New Earth will emerge because we all decide to do so together! We are building a New World! Why do we need Kambrium? People need to see and experience that it is possible to do business, live, and work without harming our environment, but rather to integrate ourselves into the entire natural structure and respect the laws of Mother Earth and her dignity. To do this, people at their current stage of development need guidance and inspiration. They must be guided in such a way that, after a while, they themselves see and experience what the results are and how it feels to suddenly live completely differently, perhaps to forego some of the supposed achievements of previous civilization, but in return to gain many other things that make life more worth living and reconnect people with the whole of creation and our soul's mission. In this way, the Earth and humanity will be healed! What does Kambrium mean? “Kambrium“ or in english “Cambrium” is a term borrowed from geology. In the Cambrian period, life took a new evolutionary beginning after the last mass extinction. It renewed and changed itself. For us, therefore, the term “Cambrian” stands for the renewal of social and modern human evolution and life on this Earth! We must now truly learn to live in harmony with the Earth, our mother, on all levels! And our company aims to enable this by guiding and inspiring people to relearn life in its entirety! We learn together! What values does Kambrium represent? A new civilization brings with it completely new challenges! The profit-oriented thinking of previous economic methods has not proven successful! Now, instead of focusing exclusively on self-interest, we must also consider the promotion and protection of all of creation, so that we learn to manage our economy in a way that harms no one, benefits everyone, and preserves the environment. People help and support each other at every level and work together with nature! All knowledge is passed on and must be accessible to everyone who strives for it! The entire life and work of human beings is based on cooperation! This is how we build a New Earth!
